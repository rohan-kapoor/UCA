# Best Practices to start with for Website design and implementation
  - Check the similar exists for designs
  - Design blueprint paper on paper as we may or may not get UX Mocks
  - Breakdown our idea into smaller components and identify which components are repeating
  - Create generic resiable componets and put them in proper place
  - Identify the components for each purpose
  - We have to decide which component should be parent and which is child - Hiereachy of the components depending on functionality under discussion
  - Deciding whether to use stateful or stateless components depending upon use case - Improves perfornace by trying to have staeless componets as pure components
  - Defining File structure. Creating a readme.md file for documentation
  - Deciding routes for the whole website
  
# Coding guidelines
